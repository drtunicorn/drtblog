Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words
[and] a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing
should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This
requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid
all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.

— Elements of Style, William Strunk, Jr. - 1918
